### Contribution Guidelines

This project is a work in progress and I welcome any help 🙏

All contributions will require a pull request. Please be respectful of everyone, and don't submit spammy PRs. If you'd like to open an issue and assign yourself, you can do so by using `.take` in the issue comments. For example you could simply type ".take" as a comment, or you can write something like "I would like to .take this issue". You'll then be assigned to that issue so you can start working on it.

Feel free to add any tips, tricks, places to visit, travel advice for anything else you like. Thank you for your contributions 💙.
