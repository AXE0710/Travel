# Japan

This is a repository for all things Japan!

It includes tips, tricks, travel advice, and more. The repository is in English, as it's designed to cater to an English speaking audience. You'll find the [tips and tricks file](https://github.com/mishmanners/Japan/blob/main/JapanTravelTips.md) under the main code tab.

If you'd like to contribute, please do!

All contributions will require a pull request. Please be respectful of everyone, and don't submit spammy PRs. If you'd like to open an issue and assign yourself, you can do so by using `.take` in the issue comments. For example you could simply type ".take" as a comment, or you can write something like "I would like to .take this issue". You'll then be assigned to that issue so you can start working on it.
