The repository is in English, as it's designed to cater to an English speaking audience. You'll find the tips and tricks files under the [country](https://github.com/mishmanners/Travel/tree/main/Countries%20) folder. Please find your country, or add a new country markdown tile. There's also a folder for [general travel advice](https://github.com/mishmanners/Travel/tree/main/General). Things can be added in any order. Feel free to add links and images. If you add images, please either credit the owner and/or add links back to the source.
